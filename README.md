# Idea for codefundo

- Use the weather models around the world, already occured natural disasters and their consequences as training data.
- Using this training data, we will build multiple training models corresponding to the things needed for sustaining life, wealth loss, etc.
- Using these models, we will try to predict the losses that might take place in the future and calculate the actions that have to be taken correspondingly.
